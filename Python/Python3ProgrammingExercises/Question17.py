# Question:
# Write a program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a
# transaction log from console input. The transaction log format
# is shown as following:

# D 100
# W 200
# D means deposit while W means withdrawal.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

# D 300
# D 300
# W 200
# D 100
# Then, the output should be:

# 500
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

total = 0
while True:
    s = input().split()
    # break if the string is empty
    if not s:
        break
    # two inputs are distributed in cm and num in string data type
    cm,num = map(str,s)
    if cm=='D':
        total+=int(num)
    if cm=='W':
        total-=int(num)
print(total)
